## Sample Space

Putting together a probabilistic model involves two steps:

1. We describe the possible outcomes of the experiment of interest;
2. We describe our beliefs about the likelihood of the different possible outcomes.

The first step, the description of possible outcomes, involves creating a set of possible outcomes, which is denoted by the capital Omega.
The set is called the 'Sample Space' and is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.

The elements of that set should have certain properties:

1. The elements should be mutually exclusive (two outcomes cannot happen at the same time);
2. The elements should be collectively exhaustive (together, the elements represent all the possibilities)
3. Physically different (that is to say, relevantly different) outcomes should be distinguished in the same space.

Note: What is relevant is dependent on the question that you are trying to answer and so, what is relevant to one experiment may not be relevant to another.

A set can be discrete, finite, infinite, continuous etc.

In the example of a tetrahedral die (a die that has four faces), numbered from 1 to 4, if we were to roll it twice (dealing with a single experiment with 2 stages), the sample space can be represented as:

1. A square grid, with x values along the bottom and y values along the side;
2. A sequential diagram (a tree);

The square grid has 16 grid spaces, one for each combination of values from the rolls;

The tree diagram has 4 branches (one for each of the values on the first stage) and 16 leaves (4 connected to each branch, representing the outcomes of the second roll).

In each case, there are 16 determinative values for the outcome of the two rolls.

## Probability axioms

- A subset of a sample space is called an event
- Non-negativity: $p(A) \gte 0$#
- $0 \lte p \lte 1$
- $P(\Omega) \lte 1$o
