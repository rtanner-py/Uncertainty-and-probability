Repo for MITx 6.431x - Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data

# Summary

I enrolled on this MITx course on 13/09/2024. This repo will contain my notes from the various lectures and wider reading, and also my solutions to the problem sets and any questions throughout the course.

My notes from the lectures will be supplemented by notes from wider reading, youtube videos and text books. Where possible, I will link to the course of any additional material in the hope that, should anyone else come across this repo and my notes, they may find these additional resources useful in their own learning journey.
